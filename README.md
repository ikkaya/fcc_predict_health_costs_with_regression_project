freeCodeCamp Prediction of Healthcare Costs Project Using TensorFlow

The dataset that contains information about different people including their healthcare costs was given. The data was used to predict healthcare costs based on new data by building a model with TensorFlow.

Challenge was achieved with 3156.31 Mean Absolute Error result which is under 3500. This means it predicts health care costs correctly within $3156.31. It is possible to reduce the error by arranging the parameters of the model or building a different algorithm.
